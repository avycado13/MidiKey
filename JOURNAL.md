## 11/3/2025 - Basic Schematic Done  

I started the schematic!

I plan on adding a joystick for pitch bend and some sort of back lit key system for looping. I am debating whether to add an lcd display.

(For fraud detection, I started the project after I started working on this)  

## 11/5/2025 - Final Schematic  

I am using a gpio expander and added more buttons and a joystick for pitch bend!
Also I added buttons for looping and/or drum beats.

 I think this is my final schematic.
